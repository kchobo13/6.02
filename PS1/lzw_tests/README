The files named test-1-unencoded, .., test-6-unencoded are unencoded
versions.  Encoding them with a maximum dictionary size of 2^16
produces their corresponding encoded versions.

If you want to test your encoding with an alternative maximum
dictionary size, we have included test-5-encoded-512 and
test-6-encoded-512.  These are the result of encoding tests 5 and 6
with a maximum dictionary size of 512 (i.e., a word size of 9).
